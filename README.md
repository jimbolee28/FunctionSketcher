# Function Sketcher

A simple Java GUI that sketches different types of functions on a semi-adjustable coordinate grid.

## Polynomial Sketcher

Run: `PolynomialGraphWindow.java`

Enter the coefficients of the polynomial you wish to graph. Make sure to separate the coefficients with spaces. If the degree of the polynomial is n, please enter n+1 coefficients according to the format below:

```
n = 1: y = Ax + B (Enter: A B)

n = 2: y = Ax^2 + Bx + C (Enter: A B C)

n = 3: y = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D (Enter: A B C D), etc...
```


## General Equation Sketcher

Run: `EquationGraphWindow.java`

Enter an equation. Be explicit with multiplication by putting an asterisk for all multiplication (no parenthetical multiplication). Fractional or variable exponents are not supported. Asymptotes may be glitchy.
